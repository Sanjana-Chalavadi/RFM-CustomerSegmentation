# RFM-CustomerSegmentation
# Project Description:

The aim of this project is to help a UK based online retailer, established in 1981 and mainly selling unique all-occasion gifts, to gain insights into their customer base and improve their business model. The merchant used to rely on mailing catalogues to addresses and taking orders via phone calls, but has recently launched its own website, shifting their business completely online. Although the retailer understands the growing importance of analytics, they lack the technical knowledge and methods to implement analytics effectively. Therefore, this project focuses on implementing advanced data mining techniques using R to determine user behavior and create customer-centric marketing strategies.
