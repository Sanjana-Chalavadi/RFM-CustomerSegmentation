# RFM-CustomerSegmentation
This project focuses on helping a UK based online retailer who has small business established in 1981 and is 
mainly selling unique all-occasion gifts. The merchant usually opted on mailing catalogues to addresses and taking 
orders via phone calls. The company recently launched its own website shifting their business completely online. 
They understand the growing importance of analytics but lack the technical knowledge and methods to improve 
their business model. The main purpose goal of this project is to help them understand its customers which can 
further aid them create customer centric marketing and in understanding their patterns. I am implementing advanced 
data mining techniques using R for determining user behavior.
